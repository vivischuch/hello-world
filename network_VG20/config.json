Data were downloaded in october, 2020.\nPubtator Central and our own scripts were used to identify the potential relationships (edges) between human genes and virus (nodes).\nWe excluded all types of reviews, letters and editorials articles and selected only associations supported by two or more documents. Biological concepts were annotated using MeSH descriptors. \nWe performed a modular analysis using the community detection algorithm implemented within Gephi software. Modules are denoted by node color.",
